# Maryland Public Records Act Reading and Quiz

In preparation for the data acquisition assignment, you'll need to familiarize yourself with the Maryland Public Information Act by reading select chapters of the Maryland Attorney General's Public Information Act Manual [Download link](http://www.marylandattorneygeneral.gov/OpenGov%20Documents/PIA_manual_printable.pdf).

Read the introduction, Chapters 1, 2, 4, 6, 7 and Appendix I ("eye").  Then take this [short quiz](https://umd.instructure.com/courses/1259604/quizzes/1263661).  
It's a good idea to skim chapter 3, which is very long, just to get a sense of the kinds of records exempt from disclosure, but you will not be quizzed on it.
