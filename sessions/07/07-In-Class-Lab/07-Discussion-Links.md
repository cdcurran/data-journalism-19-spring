## Open Data Created by News Organization

In recent years, we have seen more news organizations building their own databases to build stories around.  

Why do news organizations build their own databases?

* The government (or a private organization) isn't collecting the information or they're only collecting some of the information. (Police shootings).
* The government has the information, but they're not putting it into an easy to use form. For example, the information is in PDFs. (Maryland coal mining inspection reports).
* The government won't give us the data (Court records scrape, Maryland and Arkansas).
* The government is doing it, but they're not doing a great job. (Police stops).

### Washington Post’s Fatal Force police shooting data

There is no centralized database of police shootings. No federal record keeping or reporting is required. When police shootings became a national issue, The Post decided to make their own database to track the issue and assist with reporting.

The Post collected this data by “culling local news reports, law enforcement websites and social media, and by monitoring independent databases such as Killed by Police and Fatal Encounters.” Google Alerts and daily research were key.

### Washington Post School Shootings

The Post collected data to see how many children have been affected by gun violence since Columbine. The data was collected “using Nexis, news articles, open-source databases, law enforcement reports, information from school websites and calls to schools and police departments.”

### More Than a Mascot

Capital News Service reporters built their own database of schools across the U.S. that currently or once used Redskins as their mascot. Because no database existed, compiled the data from news reports, examining thousands of school website, and other information.

### Baltimore Sun homicide map

Data collected and entered by Justin Fenton, The Baltimore Sun’s crime reporter. The homicide rate is a constant story in Baltimore, so having up to date, easy to access, reliable number is very important. It also functions as a check of the police department, who may be more likely to fudge numbers if not for this watchdog service.

### ProPublica Documenting Hate

“Hate crimes and bias incidents are a national problem, but there’s no reliable data on their nature or prevalence. We’re collecting and verifying reports, building a database of tips for use by journalists, researchers and civil-rights organizations.” The public can submit tips.  

### Stanford Open Policing Project

“On a typical day in the United States, police officers make more than 50,000 traffic stops. Our team is gathering, analyzing, and releasing records from millions of traffic stops by law enforcement agencies across the country. Our goal is to help researchers, journalists, and policymakers investigate and improve interactions between police and the public.”

The project is working state by state to obtain police stop data, standardize it and make it available to journalists. This contains a trove of important data about how police conduct traffic stops in the United States and how racial bias could be involved. Though not created by a news organization, this project is being run by journalists for journalists.
