## Questions

1. Did Part 1 crimes increase in the year after the unrest in Baltimore in April 2015, as compared to the year before? What specific crimes increased the most? What crimes increased by the biggest percentage?

Yes, they did.  Total numbers went from 45,901 in the year before to 49,174 in the year after, a 7 percent increase. In raw numbers, auto theft (1506 increase), street robberies (749 increase) and aggravated assault (640 increase).  The biggest percentage point increase was robbery-carjacking (80 percent increase), shooting (74 percent), homicide (59 percent increase).

2. In what neighborhood (not police district, neighborhood) did Part 1 crimes go up the most? By what percentage did crime go up there? What specific crime went up the most there and by what percent?

Upton had the biggest raw number increase, 181 total crimes, it went up 36 percent. The Villages of Homeland had the biggest percentage jump, up 500 percent, from 3 crimes before to 18 after.  

In Villages of Homeland, the jump was largely due to a 1000 percent increase -- from 1 to 11 -- in car breakins. In Upton, there were big increases in auto theft, burglary and other crimes.

3. In what neighborhood (not police district, neighborhood) did Part 1 crimes go up the least (or even decrease)? By what percentage did crime go up or down there? What specific crime went up the most there and by what percent?
The biggest drop was in Port Covington, a 69 percent decrease (total number of 67 reduction). Most of that drop can be explained by a huge drop in larceny.

4. Carjackings increased significantly in the year after the unrest. In what district did carjackings increase the most?

There were more carjackings all across the city.  The biggest percentage increase was the Central District, up 162 percent.

5. Did robberies (not just one kind of robbery, but all robbery as a whole) increase after the unrest? By what percentage?

Yes, by 27 percent. Way above the 5 percent increase for non-robberies.

6. By what percent did violent crime as a whole go up after the riot? Violent crimes include all categories of assault, homicide, rape, robbery and shooting.
Yes, it went up 13 percent.
7. You are a reporter for the Baltimore Sun, and have been tasked with analyzing this data and writing a story that answers the question: how did crime change in the year after the unrest?  Write the first few grafs of a story to show to your editor.

8. This data will tell you how crime changed, and where it changed, but it will not tell you *why* it changed.  To figure that out, you will need to interview people, look at other records and possibly analyze other data.  Write 200-300 words that explains how you would build a story on top of your analysis.  The following stories may give you ideas:
