# Class 5 In Class Lab
## Tracking Clues to Databases

### Goal of Today's Lab

This lab is designed to help you get better and finding the hints and clues that a government agency may have a database you can request, by finding some of the markers (web forms, paper forms, reports, etc...) we discussed in class today).

### Find markers of databases

You and a partner will draw out of a hat, at random, two Maryland state government agencies, and one Maryland County.  The full list is below.  

Then find the website of the agencies you have drawn on [this list](http://www.maryland.gov/pages/agency_directory.aspx).

Using all of your Internet research skills, scour these sites for some of the things that could reveal the (possible) existence of a database you could query.

* "Paper", PDF or Word doc forms.
* Web forms that allow people to submit data online.
* Online tools that allow you to search for data in a limited way.
* Reports that contain summary data.
* Evidence of computerized documents produced by the government.   

### Forum posts

There is a discussion forum for this lab.  

When you find a clue to a potential database, create a new discussion post and post the link to the page (or form) where you found the information, along with a sentence (two max) describing the piece of evidence.  

If you can quickly note why this information it gathers might be useful as a journalist, put it down.  But this step is NOT required.

**In fact, even if it's NOT obvious to you how you'd use the database where the information is collected, or why it could be interesting to the public, put it down!**

Move fast! My goal here is for you to post as many links and brief descriptions as possible.  Do not fret about writing the perfect description.

Work with your partner and share what you're finding as you go.  If you find a great page on a website, use it.
