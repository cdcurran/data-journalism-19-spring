# Class 5 Homework Assignment
## Excel Assignment 3   

## Objective

This assignment is designed to build on your previous work with Excel.

It will cover the same materials: using Excel, sorting and writing formulas. Unlike the previous assignments, which asked you to do very specific tasks, this one is more free form.  

Because of that, it more closely replicates the process of using data in the newsroom for a quick-turn, non-investigative story. A newsworthy event has just happened.  You have some data about that event.  And it's your job to come up with questions -- to interview it -- and answer those questions through your analysis.  In short, it's up to you to find the story.

## Turning it in

Upload both your edited spreadsheet and a text file with your findings to the [ELMS course page for this assignment](https://umd.instructure.com/courses/1251920/assignments/4732120).          

## Analyzing presidential politics in Maryland

Use the spreadsheet [2016_2012_presidential_maryland.xlsx](data/2016_2012_presidential_maryland.xlsx).

It has two tabs.  The first tab, 2016, has county-by-county totals for each major presidential ticket in Maryland in 2016 (Democratic, Republican, Libertarian, Green) as well as a tabulation of other votes (including write-ins).  The second tab has the same data, but for 2012.     

## Data Cleaning and Extra Credit(!)
The data was scraped, cleaned and summarized by your professor from these Maryland Board of Elections pages: [2016](http://elections.maryland.gov/elections/2016/results/general/gen_detail_results_2016_4_BOT001-.html), [2012](http://elections.maryland.gov/elections/2012/results/general/gen_detail_results_2012_4_BOT001-.html).  

If you have time, I would highly recommend trying to build your own spreadsheets from this raw data, instead of using mine, by copying and pasting these tables into Excel, deleting columns and rows as needed, and adding all of the "other/write-in" votes into one column. In fact, I will give you an additional 20 percentage points on your assignment if you a) tell me you built your own and b) show evidence of your process in a spreadsheet.

Welcome to data journalism!   

## Set up the sheet.

Set up the spreadsheets as you have in previous assignments.

## Finding the story  

Here's the scenario.  It's Election Night 2016. You are a reporter for the Baltimore Sun.  Candidate Donald Trump has just won the election, defeating Hillary Clinton in a shocking upset. Trump lost badly to Clinton in Maryland, a heavily Democratic state.  

Your editor has assigned you to analyze this county-by-county data and come up with the most interesting story you can about how Trump and Clinton performed in Maryland.  You may find it useful to compare the candidates' performance to the Republican and Democratic candidates.  You may find it useful to look at the geography of where the candidates did and did not perform well.  

Please avoid reading news coverage from Maryland from just after the 2016 election. I'm looking for you to develop your own ideas.

Develop questions to ask of the data.  Look for trends, commonalities and outliers. You will find it useful to create totals, calculate change, calculate percent change, calculate share of total and to write functions. Before doing this, you will certainly find it useful to create a new tab and combine the 2012 and 2016 data.

## Writing up your findings             

In a text file, write up the three most interesting things you discovered in your analysis that help explain the 2016 presidential election in Maryland.

Then write up one of those findings as the top of a story, with a lede and one or two supporting sentences.  

Upload the text file, and your edited spreadsheet, to this [ELMS page](https://umd.instructure.com/courses/1251920/assignments/4732120).
