# Class 4 Homework Assignment
## Excel Assignment 2   

## Objective

This assignment is designed to build on your previous work with Excel. It will cover the same materials: using Excel, sorting and writing formulas.

## Turning it in

Copy the questions into a text file (.txt) or markdown file (.md), and put your answers below the questions.

You will also be uploading your edited spreadsheet, with new columns for calculations.

## Analyzing school poverty through lunch data

Download the spreadsheet [school_lunch_2018.xlsx](data/school_lunch_2018.xlsx).

It has information on children enrolled in a program that provides free and reduced-price lunches to needy students. This type of data is often used a measure for poverty in schools, though it is an imperfect measure. This data has information for Maryland's 10 largest school systems. The full data is [available through the State of Maryland](http://www.marylandpublicschools.org/programs/Pages/School-Community-Nutrition/FreeReducedPriceMealStatistics.aspx).

For the first part of this assignment, use the worksheet "Lunch14v18". It has these fields:

* County: School system
* State: State
* Free14: Children getting free lunches, 2014
* Reduced14: Children getting reduced-price lunches, 2014
* Enroll14: Children enrolled in school, 2014
* Free18: Children getting free lunches, 2018
* Reduced18: Children getting reduced-price lunches, 2018
* Enroll18: Children enrolled in school, 2018

### Setup the Spreadsheet

Set up the spreadsheet as instructed previously.

1. Save a new copy to preserve the original data.
2. On the far left of the sheet, add a sequence column of consecutive numbers to allow you to return to the original sort order.
3. Freeze panes to make the column header row "sticky" as you scroll down.
4. Add a "source" tab, and link to the original source of the data. [FARMS data](http://www.marylandpublicschools.org/programs/Pages/School-Community-Nutrition/FreeReducedPriceMealStatistics.aspx)

### Questions

1. For each school system, combine the number of children getting free lunches and reduced-price lunches in 2014 and put that in a new column. Do the same thing for 2018 and put that in another new column.

Then indicate the following for Prince George’s County:

* Free and reduced price total for 2014
* Free and reduced price total for 2018
* Change (in numbers of students) from 2014 to 2018
* Percent increase or decrease from 2014 to 2018

2. For each school system, calculate the change in the number of students enrolled from 2014 to 2018 and put that in a new column. Then calculate the percent change in enrollment from 2014 to 2018 and put that in another new column.

Then indicate the following for Prince George’s County:
* Number change in enrollment from 2014 to 2018
* Percent change in enrollment from 2014 to 2018

3. For each school system, calculate the share of the total (of the 10 school systems) for children getting free and reduced price lunches in 2018. Then indicate Prince George’s County’s share of the total, expressed as a percent.

4. For each school system, calculate student enrollment for 2018 as a share of the total (of the 10 school systems) enrollment for 2018. Then indicate Prince George’s County’s share of the total, expressed as a percent.

5. For each school system, calculate the percentage of total students in that system getting free and reduced-price-lunches for 2014, expressed as a percentage.  Then calculate the same for 2018. How did Prince George's County's rate change.

6. Using this data, what would you say is the best way to look at the changes from 2014 to 2018? You may add any fields and calculations you think you need to identify areas with the most striking changes or to detect any striking changes at the regional level. Feel free to use the sheet "Five years", which includes data not just for 2014 and 2018, but also 2015, 2016 and 2017.

Imagine that you are a reporter at The Washington Post and that your editor is eager for a story. Do the following in the space below:

* First, list two or three specific findings that you would want to highlight in a story or pursue as leads.
* Then write at least two leads based the data you have.
* Finally, since the actual lead and story you would write, would be based on more than just the data you have here, make a list of some of the other things you would want to do to report this story and bring it to life. Who would you want to call? Where would you want to go? What questions would you want to ask?
