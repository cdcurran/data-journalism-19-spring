# SESSION 5 OUTLINE

NOTES: Need to improve this, with notes about how these could be used in stories.
Need to confirm that databases exist for some of these.  
Could be good to do with previous projects. 
## Openers

* Homework (Excel. Readings. Memo.)

## Clues to Government Databases

Governments are awash in data.

Data that we can use to identify problems, to right wrongs, to make sense of the world.  

Data that we can use to tell stories.

But first, we have to get it.    

## Start with Open Data sites.

Here's one spot.  

Pull up and explain https://data.maryland.gov/browse?limitTo=datasets

343 data sets. There is definitely some useful information here, and we'll talk more about Open Data.  

Show this site. Ask how we could use it? https://data.maryland.gov/Energy-and-Environment/Reported-Sewer-Overflows/3rgd-zjxx

Ok, this is great, but there is no way this accounts for all of the data collected by Maryland.  

Remember, governments are awash in data.

Most large local governments have one of these open data sites.

Pull up and explain https://data.baltimorecity.gov/

103 data sets. Definitely some useful info here, but how many people think this is everything Baltimore has?  

Show this data. ask how we could use it? https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Public-Safety/BPD-Arrests/3i3v-ibrt

Ideas: trends of arrests by geography, racial breakdown

What's missing?

The officer's name? The arrestees names? Why might those be useful?

Analysis by officer? Follow up to interview arrestees?

## Clues to Databases

This open data site is a clue that there's a bigger, better database out there. One that has both officer name and arrestee name.  

Ask why does that seem likely?

And in fact, there are clues all over the web to the existence of databases, if you know where to look.  

Ask them: what are some of the other places to look for clues? In the readings? List them all out first, then let's talk about them.

* Open Data sites.
* Online tools that allow you to search for data (but only in limited ways).
* Web forms: where a user submits data online.
* Paper forms.  
* Computerized documents produced by the government. (a license. a deed.)
* Data in reports.

## Open Data Sites

We've all got the data.maryland.gov in front of us.  Let's take a minute and find a dataset that we think is a clue to another database, maybe one with more information.

Why do you think that?

## Online tools powered by web databases
