### Notes on Stories
* Buyouts Won’t Be the Answer for Many Frequent Flooding Victims | ProPublica | November 2017
  * Harris County, Texas, which includes Houston, has bought over 3000 homes in flood-prone areas in the past three decades. It’s more than any other county, as far as ProPublica can tell. But that number barely makes a dent in the number of homes in high-risk areas, which means they’ll have to continue to pay enormous amounts in insurance payouts when those homes inevitably flood again.
  * FEMA and county data.  Probably through PIA.
  * Lots of victims interviewed.
* Bussed Out: How America moves its homeless | Guardian US | December 2017
  * Cities are sending away homeless people on one-way bus tickets by the thousands, but not solving homelesseness. Just moving around the problem.
  * Used public records requests to query a bunch of cities build data on 30K journeys.  
  * Built out with homeless interviews.
* The thousands of U.S. locales where lead poisoning is worse than in Flint | Reuters | December 2016
  * Reuters investigated lead poisoning in small children under age 6 throughout the U.S. to pinpoint specific locations (other than Flint) that were most affected by this crisis. They found almost 3,000 areas with lead poisoning numbers “double those in Flint during the peak of the city’s contamination crisis.”
  * Used CDC and state data. Massive public records requests "The nationwide map constructed through this analysis has empty spaces: The available data includes 21 states, home to around 61 percent of the U.S. population. Health departments in some states didn’t possess the data or respond to records requests. Others wouldn’t share it, saying they weren’t required to, or citing patient privacy laws.""
* Fines Slashed In Grain Bin Entrapment Deaths | NPR and CPI | March 2013. (The data)
* Explorer Has Higher Rate of Tire Accidents | Washington Post | October 2000
  * Ford Explorer has a high rate of tire-related accidents, whether these tires are Firestone brand or Goodyear. Though Ford officials insisted that the 101 accidents that killed Americans were related to the Firestone tire problem, the issue continued when Explorers with Goodyear tires had a higher rate of tire-related accidents than any other SUV in the national fatal accident records. In addition, The near 25,000 fatal and nonfatal SUV accidents with 83 blow tires in Florida show tire blowouts in Explorers with Goodyear tires contributed to more than double the accidents of other SUVs.
  * NHTSA and Florida data.  
* The Color of Debt: How Collection Suits Squeeze Black Neighborhoods | ProPublica | October 2015
  * Big analysis found collection lawsuits much more common in black Neighborhoods than white neighborhoods, even when controlling for income. Found huge racial disparities in some kinds of collections, especially subprime loans. TRANSPARENT. Whole story on methodology
  * Method: gathered civil court data cases with collection judgments. Grouped suits by census tracts, to get race data.  Controled for income to isolate effect of race. Really transparent about methods.
* The Disproportionate Risks of Driving While Black | New York Times | October 2015
  * "But an analysis by The New York Times of tens of thousands of traffic stops and years of arrest data in this racially mixed city of 280,000 uncovered wide racial differences in measure after measure of police conduct.Those same disparities were found across North Carolina, the state that collects the most detailed data on traffic stops. And at least some of them showed up in the six other states that collect comprehensive traffic-stop statistics. Here in North Carolina’s third-largest city, officers pulled over African-American drivers for traffic violations at a rate far out of proportion with their share of the local driving population. They used their discretion to search black drivers or their cars more than twice as often as white motorists — even though they found drugs and weapons significantly more often when the driver was white."
  * PIA of traffic stops.  Police stops project. Super messy data.
* Docs on Pharma Payroll Have Blemished Records, Limited Credentials | ProPublica | October 2010
  * The article looked into the widespread practice of pharmaceutical companies paying doctors generous sums of money to promote drugs to other physicians so that they will, in turn, prescribe them to their patients.
  * ProPublica compiled from the data from disclosures by seven companies to create their own database (unfortunately the work to their database doesn’t work). In total they found that the companies had paid $257.8 million to their promotional doctors. While the companies are required to disclose this information, ProPublica says they created a database to spot trends in the data, which would otherwise be hard to find. They then looked into the credentials of the highest paid doctors, finding that 250 had received FDA warnings at some point.
  * Transparency: ProPublica relases all the data https://projects.propublica.org/docdollars/
* A $72-million apartment project. Top politicians. Unlikely donors. | LA Times | October 2016
* Shoot to Kill: Why Baltimore is one of the most lethal cities in the U.S. | Baltimore Sun | September 2016
  * In many places, if you get shot, you are more likely to die than ever before.In Baltimore, one of every three people struck by gunfire dies, up from one death in every four shootings the previous decade. It ranks as one of the most lethal of America's largest cities, according to a Baltimore Sun analysis. Two other cities — Washington and New Orleans — shared the brutal distinction of one in three shootings ending in a homicide in 2015. Like Baltimore, several cities have seen the death grip tighten. In Chicago, one in 10 people died after being shot in 2000; now one in six perishes.
  * The Baltimore Sun undertook a yearlong investigation into this rarely studied phenomenon, documenting patterns of lethality based on hundreds of crime statistics, hospital data and gun trace reports as well as interviews with police chiefs, homicide detectives, criminologists, medical experts, community activists, victims of gun violence and the perpetrators themselves.
* Wilmington, Delaware, leads U.S. in teen shootings | News Journal/USA Today | September 2017
  * Rate of shootings by people under 18 (adjusted for population) much higher in small cities. But an Associated Press and USA TODAY Network analysis of Gun Violence Archive data — gathered from media reports and police press releases, and covering a 3½ year period through June of this year — reveals that Wilmington far and away leads the country in its rate of shootings among young people under 18.
  * Built data from media reports and press releases -- is this accurate?
* High-speed police chases have killed thousands of innocent bystanders | USA Today | July 2015
* Unarmed and Shot in the Back | Atlanta Journal-Constitution | 2016
  * The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and Channel 2 Action News found that nearly half of the 184 Georgians shot and killed by the police from 2010 until 2016 were unarmed or shot in the back. The story also reported that blacks killed by the police during that time-frame were more likely to have been shot in the back or unarmed than whites, and that all of the police shootings since 2010 were deemed lawful by the criminal justice system.
  * The data secured by the AJC and Channel 2 were impressive. They compiled six years of police shooting cases from the Georgia Bureau of Investigations and built a comprehensive database themselves.  According to the story, the “files included police incident reports, investigative notes, crime scene photos and videos, medical examiner reports, autopsies and other records.” Demographic information was gleaned from death records. The story notes that the reporters secured the data via public records requests and also conducted more than 100 interviews.
* The Tennis Racket | BuzzFeed.News | January 2016
  * BuzzFeed News began its investigation after devising an algorithm to analyse gambling on professional tennis matches over the past seven years. It identified 15 players who regularly lost matches in which heavily lopsided betting appeared to substantially shift the odds – a red flag for possible match-fixing.
  * Gif Based methodology https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johntemplon/how-we-used-data-to-investigate-match-fixing-in-tennis. Algorithim looking for odds moving a lot, ran simulations on odds, showing improbability. 

### Project Outline - 25 minutes
* Idea is to go through the process of getting a database from a state or local government agency, not a federal database, using the Maryland Public Information Act.  
* This database CANNOT be available online already.
* It's okay if you don't get it.  You will be graded on the effort.
