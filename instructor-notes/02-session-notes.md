# Session 02 Instructor Notes

FIX SHEET SO IT'S NOT FREEZE PANED
FIX IMAGE 17 -- has wrong totals!

Took about 1 hour for all students to finish excel assignment and move on to homework.

Note to them I've scanned chapters of handbook and put in course files, because several people haven't gotten yet.

Get them working on the in-class lab.

If they finish, start on homework assignment.

Towards the end of class, go over homework. Note that it's due SEPT 3 BY MIDNIGHT.
