# Session 02 Instructor Notes

Data Analysis
* Today we begin the process of learning basic data analysis.
* Or, rather, in the same way that we can interview human sources, we can treat data as a source.
* A flawed source, possibly with problems, but a source.
* And we can ask questions of it, if we a) know how to think of questions we can ask and b) know how to "operationalize" them into a form data understands.
* That's what we'll do today -- begin the process of taking questions we have an analyzing them.
* Looking at federal budget today.  Asking questions like: how much total money was spent? How much did spending change between one year and another?
* For homework tonight -- which car had the highest rate of fatal crashes? Are there more uninsured people than there used to be. 

Took about 1 hour for all students to finish excel assignment and move on to homework.

Note to them I've scanned chapters of handbook and put in course files, because several people haven't gotten yet.

Get them working on the in-class lab.

If they finish, start on homework assignment.

Towards the end of class, go over homework. Note that it's due SEPT 3 BY MIDNIGHT.
