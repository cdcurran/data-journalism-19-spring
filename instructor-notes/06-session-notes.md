    * What was your finding?
    * What question did you start with?
    * How did you operationalize it?

## Great database hunt and major assignment! - 20 minutes
* Major assignment due Tuesday.  Memo 1 for data acquisition project. Read requirements.
* You can pick from these ideas, or go another direction.
* If people have same data to go after, person with more persuasive thoughtful memo and who has done more "reporting" gets to do it.  
* I really want someone to go after SDAT database.  
* Review what people found and ideas.

## Crime in Context - 5 minutes
* What were main takeaways here?
* After reading this piece, is it reasonable to conclude that violent crime, including homicide, is "up" in Baltimore in recent years? Why or why not? Could you find evidence to reach an opposing conclusion?
* It has spiked recently, for certain crimes, like homicide.  Over the Medium and long term, violent crimes are down.  How you frame the story matters?  More data is usually more accurate than less data.

## Today's Lab - 55 minutes
* Today we're going to work with open data on the web.
  * Lots of great open data on sites like data.baltimorecity.gov
  * Most of the good stuff is not there.
  * But a lot of work we can still do.
* Technically, we're going to learn how to filter data, some great new functions and probably the most useful thing in excel - Pivot Tables!    
* We're going to work with crime data from Baltimore to look at what happened to crime in Baltimore City before and after the unrest in 2015 that followed Freddie Gray's death.
  * Ask: does anyone have a sense of what happened in Baltimore? Certain types of crimes spiked
  * Ask: does anyone have a sense of why? Police pulled back. This isn't reflected in data, based on follow-up investigative reporting.

## Homework
* Excel Assignment 4
