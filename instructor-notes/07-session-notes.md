## News Organizations Building Their Own Databases - 15 minutes
  * NOTE: before clicking into link, let's talk this part out.
  * Sometimes, you can get databases in formats you can immediately analyze from a government agency.  
  * In recent years, we have seen more and more news organizations building their own databases to build stories around by gathering information through a mix of their own reporting and official data sets, or computational methods.  
  * Why do news organizations build their own databases?
    * The government (or a private organization) isn't collecting the information or they're only collecting some of the information. (Police shootings).
    * The government has the information, but they're not putting it into an easy to use form. For example, the information is in PDFs. (Maryland coal mining inspection reports).
    * The government won't give us the data (Court records scrape, Maryland and Arkansas).
    * The government is doing it, but they're not doing a great job. (Police stops).
  * Review examples on Discussion Links page. For each example, worth thinking about work that goes into it and why they are doing it. Key points.
    * Takes a lot of work. Ongoing maintenance.
    * Release in a way they encourage others to use.  Data IS the story, in some respect.
    * The more transparent about methodology, the better.
    * Just because journalists made it, doesn't mean you can trust it.  Do your homework.
