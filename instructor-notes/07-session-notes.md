# SESSION 7 OUTLINE

Notes: next time I teach this, make slides to show .  

Need more discussion around pitfalls of this.  And benefits.

Need to work through the in-class lab a bunch, because so much uncertainty in the data.  These are good lessons for them to come across.  They need to discover nested if statements on their own.  Using AND instead of OR in if statements. Also, to figure out number of guns, ISNUMBER(SEARCH) had to discover that.  
Need to show them resources for advanced Excel functions. Put that in for this class.
ALSO: need to update ALL of the pivot table assignments so that we have them copy filtered sheets into new sheets and then producing pivot table off of that.

Increasingly, news orgs are collecting their own data to fill in holes in federal, state and private data collection.

They're doing this because:

--the government isn't doing it.
--the government is doing it, but they're not doing a great job. (spotty information, old data).
--the government is doing it, but they're making it hard for people to get.
--the government is doing it, but not transparent about how they get the information.  
--governments may be doing it, but no one has pulled it all together.  

Examples:

1. Washington Post’s Fatal Force police shooting data

There is no centralized database of police shootings. No federal recordkeeping or reporting is required. When police shootings became a national issue, The Post decided to make their own database to track the issue and assist with reporting.

The Post collected this data by “culling local news reports, law enforcement websites and social media, and by monitoring independent databases such as Killed by Police and Fatal Encounters.” Google Alerts and daily research were key.

2. Washington Post School Shootings
Post collected data to see how many children have been affected by gun violence since columbine. The data was collected “using Nexis, news articles, open-source databases, law enforcement reports, information from school websites and calls to schools and police departments.”

More Than a Mascot
[Story, Data](http://cnsmaryland.org/more-than-a-mascot-redskins-high-schools/)

Capital News Service reporters built their own database of schools across the U.S. that currently or once used Redskins as their mascot. Because no database existed, compiled the data from news reports, examining thousands of school website, and other information.

3. Baltimore Sun homicide map

Data collected and entered by Justin Fenton, The Sun’s crime reporter. The homicide rate is a constant story in Baltimore, so have up to date, easy to access, reliable number is very important. It also functions as a check of the police department, who may be more likely to fudge numbers if not for this watchdog service.

4. ProPublica Documenting Hate
https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/hatecrimes
“Hate crimes and bias incidents are a national problem, but there’s no reliable data on their nature or prevalence. We’re collecting and verifying reports, building a database of tips for use by journalists, researchers and civil-rights organizations.” The public can submit tips.

5. Stanford Open Policing Project
https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/

“On a typical day in the United States, police officers make more than 50,000 traffic stops. Our team is gathering, analyzing, and releasing records from millions of traffic stops by law enforcement agencies across the country. Our goal is to help researchers, journalists, and policymakers investigate and improve interactions between police and the public.”

The project is working state by state to obtain police stop data, standardize it and make it available to journalists. This contains a trove of important data about how police conduct traffic stops in the United States and how racial bias could be involved.

Though not created by a news organization, this project is being run by journalists for journalists.
