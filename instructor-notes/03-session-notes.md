# Session 03 Instructor Notes

# NOTES REVIEWS
--The lede reviews was pretty boring. Little engagement.  So need to find a better way to do that.
--Also need to find a better way to set up the "using records for something other than their purpose" discussion.
--Eliminate the priceonomics story
--Consider killing investigative reporters's handbook except for chapter 1.  And assign more readings.
--The discussion of individual stories was a HIT.

CLASS SETUP -- READ FORUM POSTS.

### Excel Assignment 1

--Pull up your sheet, your answers. Also pull up the answer key and the answer excel sheet.

*Cars*
Great job. Almost all of you got these all right.  No need to review.

**AS WE READ THROUGH THESE, two things.  Are they CORRECT? ARE THEY NEWSWORTHY? HOW COULD THEY BE IMPROVED.**

--The Hyundai Accent had the highest rate of fatal car crashes for automobiles made between 2011 and 2014, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Reports.

--The Hyundai Accent was ranked the most dangerous of 209 different models according to a study done by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.

--Hyundai Accent, Kia Rio and Scion tC involved with most fatal crashes.

--More drivers died behind the wheel of 2012-2014 Hyundai Accents than any other vehicle, according to an analysis of 208 models of cars, SUVs and trucks.

--More people died in accidents involving Hyundai Accents than in accidents involving more than 200 other vehicle models.

--Would you be afraid of driving a Hyundai Accent?

--Four of the top five vehicles with the highest overall death rates are classified as minicars according to a study released by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.

--Despite being one of the less popular vehicles on the road, the Nissan Titan Crew Cab is among the leaders in fatal crash rates, according to data from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.

--Hyundai, Kia, Chevy, Nissan and Ford car makes have the highest death rates in accidents compared to other 	models, according to an analysis of a highway safety report. Mini cars of different makes and models have shown the highest death rate compared to other sizes, according to an analysis of a highway safety report.

**The Hyundai Accent had the highest rate of driver deaths in a comprehensive analysis of vehicle safety by an insurance industry group released Tuesday.**

**Looking for the safest possible car?  You might want to avoid the tiniest automobiles. "Minis" -- including the Kia Rio and Hyundai Accent -- had the highest rate of driver deaths in a vehicle safety analysis released by an insurance industry group Tuesday.**

**QUESTION: Would you use this data?**

Notes: Pull up the original sheet.  I gave you this data.  Show range.  95 percent of the time, will be somewhere within this range.  Big variation.  Would you be comfortable using it.  How would you address in a story.

My Take: Sure, if it's transparent, and if I'd talked with the people who made the data to make sure I understand how it could be used responsibly.

*Population*
Go over all of these. A lot of misses.

GO OVER ALL OF THESE

Q1:Montana has lots of OLDS.  So does Florida.

### Takeaway from Sun-Sentinel Speeding Cops Story

Who wants to summarize the main point, set us up?

Who wants to explain how they got the data?

**Obtaining cops' toll records and calculating how fast it took them to drive between toll stations by measuring the distance with a GPS.**

What did you take away from how they did this story?

* Emphasizes the need to think creatively.  
* Use data for a purpose other than how it was captured, and combining data sets (GPS and Toll Records).
* We do that a lot. It's not uncommon.  Government agencies have one reason for capturing data, and we have different motives.
* Takes a LOT of work.

**Q: Can we think of other cases where we might use a database to get information for something other than it was intended? Let's take five minutes.**

--Property records, to find out where someone lives. These weren't created as tax roll.    

--Scrape of court records, to analyze whether there's bias in policing.

### Takeaway from KC Star Piece

Who wants to summarize the main point, set us up?

Hundreds of police crashes in the KC Metro area, with at least 23 dead, many for pointless reasons.

Anyone else?

Who wants to explain how they got the data?

Anyone Else?

* Combo of FARS, public records requests to police departments, news reports, other sources.  
* FARS woefully undercounts. Several agencies refused to comply.  
* But, they were able to say "at LEAST 706" pursuit related crashes. 23 dead.
* Also: a LOT of work to come up with this number.

**Question: should they have done this story?**

A: My take: yes, most investigations will have these flaws, if you're doing it right. Important to be transparent.

### Takeaway from Herald Voters.
Who wants to summarize the main point, set us up?

2800 felons on voter rolls, at least 105 voted, 70 percent registered Democrats

Anyone else?

Who wants to explain how they did the story, in terms of data?

Anyone Else?

* For the moment, let's set aside the question of whether felons should be able to vote.  I think they should, a lot of the charges that keep people from voting are BS drug charges.
* For my taste, story is a little "felon panicky".
* But it is a good example of using data creatively to find a newsworthy story -- thousands of violations of the law in a close election.
* They took a database of voter rolls (name, dob, party affiliation, phone number, email and back then SSN, and WHEN you voted, but not who you voted for).  They matched it up with a criminal database.
* One database is good.  But putting databases together is key.
* This is a complicated process, required a lot of manual checking to make sure you don't misidentify someone as a felon or say a felon voted illegally.
* Also, this story demonstrates this may have originated with a database, but an unbelievable amount of follow-up reporting.    
* Read this paragraph: "In addition to different addresses, some felons use different birth dates, different Social Security numbers and different identities. Eladio Hernandez, a 59-year-old painter, says he is not the Eladio Hernandez who shot a man in the leg 17 years ago. But his voting application record carries the same Social Security number as the conviction record. When Hernandez accepted a plea bargain, Judge John Tanksley asked: "Do you understand when the court adjudicates you guilty you will be a convicted felon under the laws of the state and as such you give up certain rights: the right to vote?. . . Do you understand that?" "Yes, " Hernandez replied."
* What did it take to get that above paragraph.  

### Takeaway from Voter ID Fraud
Who wants to summarize the main point, set us up?
31 instances of voter ID fraud out of almost 1 billion ballots cast.  
Source of the data?
News reports, generally

* The thing I want you to think about here is the source of the data.
* Be skeptical.  

Q: Is it fair to say problem doesn't exist because there aren't a lot of news reports about it?

* It's entirely possible that this is not a problem, likely even.  I'm just not convinced from the data he cites.

### Takeaway from HANDBOOK
* A lot of you realized this book is hilariously dated.  
  * It refers to outdated links
  * It tries to convince people why it's good to use the internet.
  * Listservs are still a thing, though!
* We have you read it, because the process still holds.
* Here's what I want you to take away.
* This is a methodological process, doing data-driven investigative reporting. Casey: "My biggest take away from the opening chapters of the Investigate Reporter's Handbook is that investigative reporting, is a long, drawn-out, careful and thorough process."
* This process lets you get deeper stories – exposing and documenting problems not known to the public, or assembling facts that provide deeper understanding of what is known to public.
* Q: How many of you read the zoo scandal story and thought: this is too much?
* Aaron: Tell your podcast story about scanning documents.
* This process showing how things really work – not just problem cases but flaws in systems – not just a single corrupt official but a system with flaws in its design.
* Anecdotes -- stories -- are still critical in the storytelling.  But more meaningful with deeper data.
* You can fall by chance into good stories, but following this process will improve your odds.
* Key questions for investigating systems: "How is a system supposed to work?" "How well is it working?" "Who benefits/who is harmed"
* Work with a "Documents/Data state of mind".  Somewhere out there is a database or a document that will make your story.  Your job is to find it, work with it and build upon it.
* Interviews go better when you have documents and data.
* The opposite is true. Documents and data go better when you have interviews. "Data journalism is often thought of as reliant on documents and database information, but no investigative story can be done entirely on a computer."

**IF TIME**

WRITE UP PAUL WILLIAMS WAY
Paul Williams Way: to ensure stories don't fall flat, "pull it all together"
  --Conception: tips are everywhere. pay attention. Read. Talk to people. Keep a file.  Screen tips, make initial steps. Often doing these in paralel.
  --Fesability Study: Are records available? Will people talk? Is there time to do story before it passes us by? What resources are needed (technical, money)?
  --Go/No GO: What is the minimum story likely to result from this story? What is the maximum? Is the minimum good enough to proceed?
  --Backgrouing: learn as much as possible about topic/Subject
  --Planning: get data, human sources, documents, etc...reporting and analysis, do interviews.
  --Original Research: Additonal analysis, Reporting
  --Revealution: after everything you know, move ahead? File now? Wait?
  --Fill in the gaps: additional reporting
  --Final evaluations
  --Writing and Rewriting
  --Publication and follow up
