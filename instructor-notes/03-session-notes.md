* Discuss Takeaways from Investigative Reporter's Handbook
* Homework

### Excel Assignment 1

--Pull up your sheet, your answers. Also pull up the answer key and the answer excel sheet.

*Cars*

Review step by step.

**Summarize ledes.**  
* One of two categories.
  * Hyundai accent highest rate.  
  * Small cars had the highest rate of fatal crashes.
* Which is better?
  * Both are newsworthy.
  * Small cars is a bigger group -- next level analysis.  IDs bigger trend.
  * Is Hyundai really that different than Kia?  
* Precision matter.
  * Some of you said Hyundai had more fatal crashes than other cars.  NOPE.  Higher rate.
* But precision doesn't always belong in your lede.
  * Keep it simple. Avoid numbers in the lede. Use trends.  
  * **The Hyundai Accent had the highest rate of driver deaths in a comprehensive analysis of vehicle safety by an insurance industry group released Tuesday.**
  * **Mini cars -- including the Kia Rio and Hyundai Accent -- had the highest rate of driver deaths in a vehicle safety analysis released by an insurance industry group Tuesday.**

**QUESTION: How did they get these numbers? Should you use them**

They are estimates dervied from sampling. 95 percent confidence. Valid statistical methodology, but not as precise as reported

"There is good reason to believe that the population mean they derived is accurate, but could be anywhere between that range, with strongest likelihood at the value they derived."

"If repeated samples were taken and the 95% confidence interval was computed for each sample, 95% of the intervals would contain the population mean.

How would you address in a story?

My Take: Sure, if it's transparent, and if I'd talked with the people who made the data to make sure I understand how it could be used responsibly.  Might overwhelm readers.

*Population*

Review step by step.

What's the news? Go around and ask a few people.

5. Imagine you are writing a lede for a national news organization the day this data is released? What would it say?  
**Lots of possibilities.
Washington, D.C. grew faster than any U.S. state between 2010 and 2016, according to new U.S. census figures released Tuesday, while Illinois, Vermont and West Virginia all lost population during that period.
Texas added nearly three million people between 2010 and 2016 -- more than any other state -- according to new U.S. Census figures released Tuesday.**
**Ideally you'd also have some sense of WHY the thing you're describing happened, but that may be beyond the scope of this assignment.**
6. Imagine you are writing a lede for the Baltimore Sun? What would it say?
**Maryland's population grew by nearly a million people between 2000 and 2016, according to new U.S. Census figures released Tuesday. OR
**Maryland's population grew by nearly five percent between 2010 and 2016 to remain the 19th largest state in the U.S., according to new U.S. Census figures released Tuesday.**

*HealthCare*
GO OVER ALL OF THESE

Q1:Montana has lots of OLDS.  So does Florida.

Q2:
https://www.kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/state-activity-around-expanding-medicaid-under-the-affordable-care-act/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Current%20Status%20of%20Medicaid%20Expansion%20Decision%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D


**A decade after the expansion of health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, about 10 percent of people in the U.S. still don't have health insurance, according to new health care data released Tuesday, with the highest levels of uninsured in states like Texas that didn't expand health care access for poor people under the new law.**

**A decade after the expansion of health care under the Affordable Care Act, about six percent of Marylanders are still uninsured, lower than the national average, according to new health care data released Tuesday.**

### Takeaway from Sun-Sentinel Speeding Cops Story

Who wants to summarize the main point, set us up?

Who wants to explain how they got the data?

**Obtaining cops' toll records and calculating how fast it took them to drive between toll stations by measuring the distance with a GPS.**

What did you take away from how they did this story?

* Emphasizes the need to think creatively.  
* Use data for a purpose other than how it was captured, and combining data sets (GPS and Toll Records).
* We do that a lot. It's not uncommon.  Government agencies have one reason for capturing data, and we have different motives.
* Takes a LOT of work.

**Q: Can we think of other cases where we might use a database to get information for something other than it was intended? Let's take five minutes.**

--Property records, to find out where someone lives. These weren't created as tax roll.    

--Scrape of court records, to analyze whether there's bias in policing.

### Takeaway from KC Star Piece

Who wants to summarize the main point, set us up?

Hundreds of police crashes in the KC Metro area, with at least 23 dead, many for pointless reasons.

How did they bring the story to life?

Who wants to explain how they got the data?

Anyone Else?

What issues were there?

* Combo of FARS, public records requests to police departments, news reports, other sources.  
* FARS woefully undercounts. Several agencies refused to comply.  
* But, they were able to say "at LEAST 706" pursuit related crashes. 23 dead.
* Also: a LOT of work to come up with this number.

**Question: should they have done this story?**

A: My take: yes, most investigations will have these flaws, if you're doing it right. Important to be transparent.

### Takeaway from Herald Voters.
Who wants to summarize the main point, set us up?

2800 felons on voter rolls, at least 105 voted, 70 percent registered Democrats

Anyone else?

Who wants to explain how they did the story, in terms of data?

Anyone Else?

Anyone have a problem with this approach?

* For the moment, let's set aside the question of whether felons should be able to vote.  I think they should, a lot of the charges that keep people from voting are BS drug charges.
* For my taste, story is a little "felon panicky".
* But it is a good example of using data creatively to find a newsworthy story -- thousands of violations of the law in a close election.
* They took a database of voter rolls (name, dob, party affiliation, phone number, email and back then SSN, and WHEN you voted, but not who you voted for).  They matched it up with a criminal database.
* One database is good.  But putting databases together is key.
* This is a complicated process, required a lot of manual checking to make sure you don't misidentify someone as a felon or say a felon voted illegally.
* Also, this story demonstrates this may have originated with a database, but an unbelievable amount of follow-up reporting.    
* Read this paragraph: "In addition to different addresses, some felons use different birth dates, different Social Security numbers and different identities. Eladio Hernandez, a 59-year-old painter, says he is not the Eladio Hernandez who shot a man in the leg 17 years ago. But his voting application record carries the same Social Security number as the conviction record. When Hernandez accepted a plea bargain, Judge John Tanksley asked: "Do you understand when the court adjudicates you guilty you will be a convicted felon under the laws of the state and as such you give up certain rights: the right to vote?. . . Do you understand that?" "Yes, " Hernandez replied."
* What did it take to get that above paragraph.  

### Takeaway from Voter ID Fraud
Who wants to summarize the main point, set us up?
31 instances of voter ID fraud out of almost 1 billion ballots cast.  
Source of the data?
News reports, generally

* The thing I want you to think about here is the source of the data.
* Be skeptical.  

Q: Is it fair to say problem doesn't exist because there aren't a lot of news reports about it?

* It's entirely possible that this is not a problem, likely even.  I'm just not convinced from the data he cites.

### Takeaway from HANDBOOK
* A lot of you realized this book is hilariously dated.  
  * It refers to outdated links
  * It tries to convince people why it's good to use the internet.
  * Listservs are still a thing, though!
* We have you read it, because the process still holds.
* Here's what I want you to take away.
* This is a methodological process, doing data-driven investigative reporting.
* This process lets you get deeper stories – exposing and documenting problems not known to the public, or assembling facts that provide deeper understanding of what is known to public.
* Q: How many of you read the zoo scandal story and thought: this is too much?
* Aaron: Tell your podcast story about scanning documents.
* This process showing how things really work – not just problem cases but flaws in systems – not just a single corrupt official but a system with flaws in its design.
* Anecdotes -- stories -- are still critical in the storytelling.  But more meaningful with deeper data.
* You can fall by chance into good stories, but following this process will improve your odds.
* Key questions for investigating systems: "How is a system supposed to work?" "How well is it working?" "Who benefits/who is harmed"
* Work with a "Documents/Data state of mind".  Somewhere out there is a database or a document that will make your story.  Your job is to find it, work with it and build upon it.
* Interviews go better when you have documents and data.
* The opposite is true. Documents and data go better when you have interviews. "Data journalism is often thought of as reliant on documents and database information, but no investigative story can be done entirely on a computer."

**IF TIME**

WRITE UP PAUL WILLIAMS WAY
Paul Williams Way: to ensure stories don't fall flat, "pull it all together"
  --Conception: tips are everywhere. pay attention. Read. Talk to people. Keep a file.  Screen tips, make initial steps. Often doing these in paralel.
  --Fesability Study: Are records available? Will people talk? Is there time to do story before it passes us by? What resources are needed (technical, money)?
  --Go/No GO: What is the minimum story likely to result from this story? What is the maximum? Is the minimum good enough to proceed?
  --Backgrouing: learn as much as possible about topic/Subject
  --Planning: get data, human sources, documents, etc...reporting and analysis, do interviews.
  --Original Research: Additonal analysis, Reporting
  --Revealution: after everything you know, move ahead? File now? Wait?
  --Fill in the gaps: additional reporting
  --Final evaluations
  --Writing and Rewriting
  --Publication and follow up
