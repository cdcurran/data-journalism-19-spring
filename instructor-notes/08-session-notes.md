## Class Intro - 5 minutes
* Review guide to class
* Reminder: if you are struggling, set up time to come see me.  I want to leave no one behind. Office hours - Monday and Thursday from 3-430.

## Data Memo - 10 minutes
* Due Thursday at 1201 am.
* Want to see a TON of reporting to answer questions it asks. Many of you didn't actually get people on the phone.  You MUST get people on the phone for the next memo.
* Do not wait until next week to start. It takes time for them to get back to you.
* This part is CRITICAL.  Without the reporting to learn about the data and how it's used, it will be hard to make a cogent request that has a high chance of success. Trust me. This is all part of the negotiation, it starts right now.
* Let's review what I'm looking for in that memo. See assignment. Read through memo 2 section.
* Examples of documentation.
  * We looked at this on first day of class.
  * Have seen several as we've gone through, mostly simple ones. Things that explain what field says.
  * Review examples.
  * The more of this you can gather, the better targeted request you can put in.
* Reiterate: report this out like you would a story. Go hard. It will pay dividends for your requests.
