## Introduction
* Introduction to relational databases
* Today's the first time we're going to be use SQL to write code to analyze data.
* This takes us beyond the spreadsheet and beyond Excel.
* A lot of what we're doing will at first seem really similar to what we've done in Excel.
* Looking at records, sorting, filtering.  Soon, we'll even get to writing code that are essentially the same thing as pivot tables.
* And compared to Excel, at first, it's going to seem a lot less intuitive, because it's writing code, as opposed to using a GUI.
* But this is a superior method.  
* It lets you work with larger data sets.  
* It lets you easily mashup two different data sets, which gives you the power to do better stories -- bus drivers with criminal records; police vehicles with toll records; health outcomes and income levels.  
* SQL is a great, easy way in to data programming, which will open the door for you to do more complicated things in other programming languages later on.
* It's part of the holy triumvirate of SQL, Python and R, commonly used together by data journalists and data scientists.
